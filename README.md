# -Prosciutto-Repo
Prosciutto (/prəˈʃuːtoʊ/,[1] Italian: [proʃˈʃutto])[2] is an Italian dry-cured ham that is usually thinly sliced and served uncooked; this style is called prosciutto crudo in Italian (or simply crudo) and is distinguished from cooked ham, prosciutto cotto.

A number of regions have their own variations of prosciutto, each with degrees of protected status, but the most prized are the Prosciutto di Parma PDO from the Emilia-Romagna region and the Prosciutto di San Daniele PDO from the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region. Prosciutto mustn't be confused with Speck Alto Adige PGI, from the South Tyrol region, which may appear similar but there are some remarkable differences.

The names prosciutto and prosciutto crudo are generic, and not protected designations, and may name or describe a variety of hams more or less similar to Italian prosciutto crudo or other dry-cured hams worldwide.[3][4][5]
